**Note:** If you already have an Arch Linux installation with any other desktop environment than Hyprland, this installation will not conflict with your current Arch, i.e. you can have this working environment in parallel without compromising your current operating system.

* **An AUR helper** (yay, paru...)

**Install the necessary packages:**
~~~
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed hyprland hyprpaper zsh alsa-utils vlc waybar polkit-kde-agent xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-gtk gnome-themes-extra fastfetch wl-clipboard wtype ranger wezterm discord dunst fontconfig zip unzip p7zip lsd bat

And put all its contents in your ```/home/<user>``` folder *(except the readme, the license and the .gitignore)*

Then, **restart your computer** and in your display manager **change the session to ```Hyprland```** and log in.

That is all. However, there are some additional adjustments you could make:

<details>
<summary>Configure multiple screens</summary>

Run ```hyprctl monitors all``` and check the name of your monitors, for example, if you have a monitor connected by HDMI, it is probably called ```HDMI-1```.

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf```, delete the auto config and replace it with this format: ```name,resolution,position,scale```

For example, if you have two monitors with the names ```HDMI-1``` and ```DP-1```, this would be a standard configuration:
~~~
monitor=HDMI-1,1920x1080@75,0x0,1
monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@60,1920x0,1
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change wallpaper</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf``` and replace the paths of ```preload``` and ```wallpaper```:
~~~
preload = /your/wallpaper/path
wallpaper = , /your/wallpaper/path
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change key binds</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/binds.conf``` and follows the structure of the other key binds in the file:
~~~
bind = SUPER SHIFT, K, exec, any-command
~~~
</details>
