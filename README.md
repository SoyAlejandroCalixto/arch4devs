### 📁 Install

**Prerequisites:**
* **A minimal installation of [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)**
    > I recommend doing an installation with the [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall_(Espa%C3%B1ol)) command choosing Hyprland as desktop. It is as simple as, once you boot the Arch Linux ISO, type ```archinstall``` and follow the simple menu that appears. It is the fastest and easiest way.

**Clone this repo and run the ```install.sh``` script:**
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/SoyAlejandroCalixto/arch4devs ~/arch4devs && cd ~/arch4devs
./install.sh
~~~
> *Once the installation is finished, you can delete the ```~/arch4devs``` directory.*

Then, **restart your computer** and in your display manager **change the session to ```Hyprland```** and log in.

**That is all**. However, you may need to make some additional adjustments for your special conditions:

<details>
<summary>Change wallpaper</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf``` and replace the paths of ```preload``` and ```wallpaper```:
~~~
preload = /your/wallpaper/path
wallpaper = , /your/wallpaper/path
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configure multiple screens</summary>

Run ```hyprctl monitors all``` and check the name of your monitors, for example, if you have a monitor connected by HDMI, it is probably called ```HDMI-1```.

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf```, delete the auto config and replace it with this format: ```name,resolution,position,scale```

For example, if you have two monitors with the names ```HDMI-1``` and ```DP-1```, this would be a standard configuration:
~~~
monitor=HDMI-1,1920x1080@75,0x0,1
monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@60,1920x0,1
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change key binds</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/binds.conf``` and follows the structure of the other key binds in the file:
~~~
bind = SUPER SHIFT, K, exec, any-command
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Make the top bar appear on all monitors</summary>

Edit ```~/.config/eww/eww.yuck``` and check this part:
~~~
(defwindow topbar0
  :monitor 0
  :geometry (geometry :x "0%" :y "0%" :width "100%" :height "28px" :anchor "top center")
  :stacking "fg"
  :reserve (struts :distance "28px" :side "top")
  :windowtype "dock"
  :wm-ignore false
  (topbar))
~~~
Duplicate that block of code below and change ```topbar0``` to ```topbar1``` and ```:monitor 0``` to ```:monitor 1```.

Now edit ```~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf``` and add ```&& eww open topbar1``` to this line so that it opens at startup next to the other one:
~~~
exec-once = eww daemon && eww open topbar0 && eww open topbar1
~~~
Repeat this process with as many screens as you want.
