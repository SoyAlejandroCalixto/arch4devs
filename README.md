**Note:** If you already have an Arch Linux installation with any other desktop environment than Hyprland, this installation will not conflict with your current Arch, i.e. you can have this working environment in parallel without compromising your current operating system.

### üóÅ Install guide

**Prerequisites:**
* **[Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide)** (actually you can install it on any Linux distro, but it is focussed and tested on Arch)
* **An AUR helper** (yay, paru...)

**Install the necessary stuff:**
~~~
# pacman packages
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed git neovim hyprland hyprpaper zsh noto-fonts-emoji adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts ttf-cascadia-code-nerd inter-font ttf-font-awesome vlc eog waybar polkit-kde-agent xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-gtk gnome-themes-extra fastfetch wl-clipboard wtype ranger wezterm discord dunst fontconfig zip unzip p7zip lsd bat

# shell stuff
chsh -s /bin/zsh && sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting && git clone https://github.com/hlissner/zsh-autopair ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autopair
~~~

**Clone the arch4devs repository**
~~~
git clone https://github.com/SoyAlejandroCalixto/arch4devs.git
~~~
And put all its contents in your ```/home/<user>``` folder *(except the readme, the license and the .gitignore)*

Then, **restart your computer** and in your display manager **change the session to ```Hyprland```** and log in.

That is all. However, you may need to make some additional adjustments for your special conditions:

<details>
<summary>Don't you see the workspaces in the top bar?</summary>

Edit ```~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc``` and check this part:
~~~
"persistent-workspaces": {
    "<anything>": [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ],
    "<anything>": [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ]
}
~~~
Now run ```hyprctl monitors all``` and check the name of your monitors, for example, if you have a monitor connected by HDMI, it is probably called ```HDMI-1```

Replace the ```<anything>``` in the example with that name. If you have more or fewer screens, add or remove items from that object.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Configure multiple screens</summary>

Run ```hyprctl monitors all``` and check the name of your monitors, for example, if you have a monitor connected by HDMI, it is probably called ```HDMI-1```.

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf```, delete the auto config and replace it with this format: ```name,resolution,position,scale```

For example, if you have two monitors with the names ```HDMI-1``` and ```DP-1```, this would be a standard configuration:
~~~
monitor=HDMI-1,1920x1080@75,0x0,1
monitor=DP-1,1920x1080@60,1920x0,1
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change wallpaper</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf``` and replace the paths of ```preload``` and ```wallpaper```:
~~~
preload = /your/wallpaper/path
wallpaper = , /your/wallpaper/path
~~~
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change key binds</summary>

Go to ```~/.config/hypr/binds.conf``` and follows the structure of the other key binds in the file:
~~~
bind = SUPER SHIFT, K, exec, any-command
~~~
</details>
