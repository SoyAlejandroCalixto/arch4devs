## Arch Linux working environment for developers

The best operating system for developers. Program in fast motion with this working environment üöÄ.

**Note:** If you already have an Arch Linux installation with any other desktop environment than QTile, this installation will not conflict with your current Arch, i.e. nothing will happen to your original installation and you can have this working environment completely parallel to your regular Arch without compromising your current operating system.

If you are an average user, this guide is over for you, but if you meet any of the following exceptions, you will need to do some additional steps.

<details>
<summary>Do you have more than one screen?</summary>
  
If you have a second screen, you must modify these 3 files:

Go to ```~/.config/qtile/autostart.sh``` and replace the text there with the following:
~~~
#!/bin/sh
polybar leftbar &
polybar rightbar &
/usr/lib/polkit-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 &
~~~

Go to ```~/.config/qtile/config.py``` and replace the Python list named ```screens``` with this one:
~~~
screens = [
    Screen(
        wallpaper='~/.local/share/backgrounds/2023-12-01-09-08-12-2023-10-23-21-38-20-image (4).png',
        wallpaper_mode='stretch',
    ),
    Screen(
        wallpaper='~/.local/share/backgrounds/2023-12-01-09-08-12-2023-10-23-21-38-20-image (4).png',
        wallpaper_mode='stretch',
    ),
]
~~~

Go to ```~/.config/polybar/config.ini``` and look for the part that says:
~~~
[bar/rightbar]
monitor = HDMI-1
~~~
and in the ```monitor``` property change ```HDMI-1``` by the connector that you have, i.e. if you use **Display Port** you should put ```DP-1```, if you use DVI-D you should put ```DVI-D-1```, and if you use HDMI you can leave it as it is in ```HDMI-1```.

**Restart the computer.**

<details>
<summary>Do you speak a language other than English?</summary>

To change the language of certain elements that polybar has, go to ```~/.config/polybar/config.ini``` and look where it says:
~~~
[bar/leftbar]
# locale = es_ES.UTF-8
~~~

uncomment the line with the ```#``` and put the value you want, for example, ```es_ES.utf-8``` would set the language to Spanish.

**Restart the computer.**
